-------------------------
- Added support for localized messages.

-------------------------
5.0.0 31JAN20
-------------------------
- Changed the way all API responses that are not 2XX, 401, or 403 are handled (these will remain as they were previously).
For all other response codes, instead of throwing exceptions the library will now return a response that contains the status code
that was received. Exceptions will continue to be thrown when the library encounters 401s and 403s.
Please examine any retry logic in your implementation to see if you need to make changes.
